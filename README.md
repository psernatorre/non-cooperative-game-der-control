This repository contains the learned state-space models of the inverters we use in this paper. The electromagnetic-transient (EMT) models of the inverters are not shared in this repository as they belong to Sandia National Laboratories. We used these inverter models during the elaboration of this paper. We are grateful for this collaboration with David (Sandia National Laboratories).
