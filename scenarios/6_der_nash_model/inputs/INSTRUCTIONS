Files:
a. state_space.m 
   It has the state-space representations of the DERs (e.g. PV1 system, BESS1, etc). Kalman Filter plus LTR are also calculated for each DER. 
   The kalman filter plus LTR are later used for the Nash equilibrium controller computation. The reason why it is necessary to use KF plus LTR
   is because System Identification framework creates new states which are fictitious.
   
   It also has the state-space representation of the combined system (DERs). It is necessary for game purposes.
   
   It has the initial conditions such as PV1 output power, and initial load.
   
   It has the references for which the system will be subjected to. For example, the power regulation request that the entire system must comply.
   
   Some load perturbations are also included.
   
b. controllers.m
   It computes the Nash equilibrium controllers following the rules of a non-cooperative games.
   It also provides droop controllers which are ones to be benchmarked.
   
c. simulation_config.m
   It sets up the parameters and run the model and grid simulation for both NE controllers and droop controllers.
   You may comment lines if you only want to run one simulation.
   
d. droop_model.slx
   State-space models with droop controllers.
 
e. droop_grid.slx
   High fidelity models (realistic DERs) with droop controllers.
    
f. nasheq_model.slx
   State-space models with NE controllers.
 
g. nasheq_grid.slx
   High fidelity models (realistic DERs) with NE controllers.
   
h. cost_analysis.slx
   Compute the individual performance metric for each player of the deviation system.
   The individual performance metric can be computed for different controllers used in the simulink files. For example: NE controller vs Droop controller.
   In this case, it makes sense to compare the results from droop_grid.slx and nasheq_grid.slx
   
Instructions:

1. Run state_space.m 

2. Run controllers.m
